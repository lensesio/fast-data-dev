The wait scripts are used by various services, in order to make sure we chain
start them.  For example Schema Registry should start only when the Broker comes
online. The Broker should start only when Zookeeper is operational. Connect
should start after both Schema Registry and the Broker are operational, so we
can just wait for Schema Registry.

It is easy to add custom wait scripts or tweak the current ones if needed by
setting the appropriate variables for each service. This functionality is
provided for advanced setups, like creating clusters.
